# A list of keys is in /usr/include/X11/keysym.h and in
# /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h 
# The XK_ is not needed. 
#
# List of modifier (on my keyboard): 
#   Control, Shift, Mod1 (Alt), Mod2 (NumLock), 
#   Mod3 (CapsLock), Mod4, Mod5 (Scroll).
#
# Another way to specifie a key is to use 'xev' and set the 
# keycode with c:nnn or the modifier with m:nnn where nnn is 
# the keycode or the state returned by xev 
#
# "command" 
# m:xxx + c:xxx 
#
#
# Used to make this config was the command 'xbindkeys -k'
# After that xvkbd works like this: http://xahlee.info/linux/linux_xvkbd_tutorial.html
# Then characters are on: http://xahlee.info/linux/linux_show_keycode_keysym.html
# And used was the command 'xev' 
# With these tools all of this can be recreated.
#
# xdotools where replaced by xvkbd a recent update becaluse it fixes the keys sometimes stuck issue.
# This post gave me the idea to try it with xvkbd instead:
